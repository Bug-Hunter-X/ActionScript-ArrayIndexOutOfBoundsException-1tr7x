This repository contains a demonstration of a common ActionScript error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The error occurs when attempting to access an array element using an index that is outside the valid range of indices (0 to length -1). The bug.as file demonstrates the error, while bugSolution.as provides the solution.  The solution handles the potential for an empty array and ensures index access is within bounds.
